And they sometimes come with either I2C or SPI:
Now for the display it is very important that you know which connection it is using.
I2C can be connected to any GPIO pin (except 16).
The SPI however requires following connections:
Display GPIO SCL/CLK/SCK GPIO 14 (D5) SDA/MOSI GPIO 13 (D7) RST, DC and CS pins can connected to any pin.</description></item><item><title>Tools</title><link>https://spacehuhn.wiki/deauther/setup/need/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jun 2020 16:59:36 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://spacehuhn.wiki/deauther/setup/need/</guid><description>Before you continue Using the display interface is completely optional.
The ESP8266 Deauther can also just be used over serial or the web interface.
You should know some basics of how to use, code and create stuff with Arduino.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t, then we highly recommend you to get some sort of Arduino starter kit and start learning. The steps of this tutorial are very simple, but if you have never done something like this, it&amp;rsquo;s very important to get a basic knowledge about the topic first!</description></item><item><title>Flashing bin file</title><link>https://spacehuhn.wiki/deauther/installation/flashing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jun 2020 16:29:54 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://spacehuhn.wiki/deauther/installation/flashing/</guid><description>Flashing the firmware bin file You can find precompiled .bin files on the release page. Be sure to download the latest version. The 1 MB file should be good for most devices. If you have a NodeMCU with an ESP-12 you can also use the 4MB file. But all in all, it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t matter that much.
Use one of the following software to flash your ESP8266 with the .bin file.</description></item><item><title>Content</title><link>https://spacehuhn.wiki/wifiduck/content/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jun 2020 18:31:57 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://spacehuhn.wiki/wifiduck/content/</guid><description> Disclaimer About Changes Hardware Supported Boards Connections PCB DSTIKE WiFi Duck Flash Software Preparations Flash Atmega32u4 Flash ESP8266 Unbrick Atmega32u4 Usage Ducky Script CLI Debug FAQ Development Edit Web Files Translate Keyboard Layout License Credits &amp;nbsp;Suggest changes &amp;nbsp;Source</description></item><item><title>Examples</title><link>https://spacehuhn.wiki/deauther/setup/wire/example/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jun 2020 17:17:28 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://spacehuhn.wiki/deauther/setup/wire/example/</guid><description>Example setup with I2C OLED Display GPIO GND GND VCC/VDD VCC / 3.3V SCL/CLK/SCK GPIO 4 (D2) SDA GPIO 5 (D1) Button GPIO UP GPIO 14 (D5) Down GPIO 12 (D6) A GPIO 13 (D7) NEOPIXEL LED GPIO GND GND VCC VCC/3.</description></item><item><title>Compiling using Arduino IDE</title><link>https://spacehuhn.wiki/deauther/installation/compiling/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jun 2020 16:41:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://spacehuhn.wiki/deauther/installation/compiling/</guid><description>First you have to install and open the Arduino IDE.

A bigger Flash size can give you more memory in the SPIFFS for saving data, scripts or other files.</description></item><item><title>Node MCU</title><link>https://spacehuhn.wiki/deauther/supporteddevices/nodemcu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jun 2020 22:55:19 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://spacehuhn.wiki/deauther/supporteddevices/nodemcu/</guid><description>This is the recommended board for beginners that want to learn more about electronics and programming!
The NodeMCU is an open source project and there are many companies producing it. The most known one is Amica. There is also a Lolin NodeMCU v3 but don&amp;rsquo;t get confused by any version number:
I always recommend the v1.0 (might be sold under a different version number). It&amp;rsquo;s the board from Amica. It is cheap, breadboard friendly and uses the cp2102, a better alternative to the old CH340 USB to serial chip.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://spacehuhn.wiki/wifiduck/about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jun 2020 22:03:50 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://spacehuhn.wiki/wifiduck/about/</guid><description>By emulating a USB keyboard, this device can be used to remote control a computer, automate tasks or execute software to gain full access. All in the matter of seconds!
This is all possible because keyboards are trusted devices, you plug it in and can start typing right away!
A human might not type very fast, but an automated device like this presses of hundreds of keys per second.
This open source project aims to provide a user-friendly tool to learn about such keystroke injection attacks.</description></item><item><title>Testing</title><link>https://spacehuhn.wiki/deauther/setup/testing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jun 2020 17:26:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://spacehuhn.wiki/deauther/setup/testing/</guid><description>Now when everything is correctly setup and uploaded, you have to open the serial monitor with arduino.
Make sure to set the baud rate to 115200 and select Newline.
If you see that the device is resetting every few seconds, check the code! Most of the time it&amp;rsquo;s that you used one pin for both the display, button or LED.
Be sure not to have used the same pin for multiple things, not on the breadboard and not in the code!</description></item><item><title>Installation tips and tricks</title><link>https://spacehuhn.wiki/deauther/installation/tips/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jun 2020 16:44:08 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://spacehuhn.wiki/deauther/installation/tips/</guid><description>These are some small tips that are beneficial for first time users of this software, and hopefully will make it more accessible and cause less headache when flashing the board.
We recommend the esptool for flashing .bin files, because it works on all platforms. You can read more about how esptool works on their github page.
For customized versions, we highly recommend using Arduino IDE and our Deauther SDK (see Compiling using Arduino IDE).</description></item><item><title>Wemos &amp; Adafruit</title><link>https://spacehuhn.wiki/deauther/supporteddevices/wemos_adafruit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jun 2020 23:11:11 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://spacehuhn.wiki/deauther/supporteddevices/wemos_adafruit/</guid><description>Wemos D1 mini The Wemos boards have decent quality, are cheap and very small.

Timeout error A typical message you get in the web interface is the red ERROR timeout loading file ... message.
Don&amp;rsquo;t worry!
It tells you that a transmission in the background failed.
This can happen because:
The ESP8266 web server is just randomly unreliable (nothing you can do here, just try again or use the OLED and buttons) The WiFi around is very crowded and transmissions are not reliable because of the high traffic (try changing the channel in the settings and restart, or use it in a less crowded area) You started an attack and the ESP8266 had to change the channel (you might have to reconnect manually) You&amp;rsquo;re scanning for stations (you can reconnect once the scan is finished) You&amp;rsquo;re attacking multiple targets and the ESP8266 has to change the WiFi channel constantly (you will have to restart to reconnect) The ESP8266 crashed - in this case, please look at Serial usage for further debugging.</description></item><item><title>Fake Boards</title><link>https://spacehuhn.wiki/deauther/supporteddevices/fakeboards/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jun 2020 23:08:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://spacehuhn.wiki/deauther/supporteddevices/fakeboards/</guid><description>You will find some cheaper boards that look like the official deauther boards but for lower prices. I highly recommend to stay away from them!
These companies like to copy Travis Lin&amp;rsquo;s (DSTIKE) designs, use my software and sell it as seemingly official Wemos boards!
Recently they started to label their boards as &amp;ldquo;TTGO&amp;rdquo;. They don&amp;rsquo;t put much effort into it, so the quality is often horrible and the PCB design very poor.</description></item><item><title>Hardware</title><link>https://spacehuhn.wiki/wifiduck/hardware/hardware2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jun 2020 17:01:12 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://spacehuhn.wiki/wifiduck/hardware/hardware2/</guid><description>Video Tutorial
This tool requires following hardware:
An Atmega32u4 based board (for example: Arduino Leonardo or Pro Micro) An ESP8266 or ESP8285 (for example NodeMCU or Wemos d1 mini) [Optional] A single Neopixel (WS2812b) or Dotstar (APA102) LED You will also need a computer and USB data cable to flash the microcontrollers.
If you&amp;rsquo;re a beginner, it&amp;rsquo;s recommended you wire everything together on a breadboard first!
So get a breadboard with a couple of jumper wires.</description></item><item><title>Projects</title><link>https://spacehuhn.wiki/deauther/projects/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jun 2020 17:00:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://spacehuhn.wiki/deauther/projects/</guid><description>A collection of cool projects people made with the ESP8266 Deauther.

This is meant as a small add-on, and not as a main feature. You can&amp;rsquo;t really program with it or do complicated stuff, and all you can do is save regular commands to a file. To show you this, I will demonstrate how to deauth a specific mac address using a script.
