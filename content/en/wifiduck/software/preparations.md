1. Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software).
2. Start the Arduino IDE, go to `File` > `Preferences`.
3. At *Additional Board Manager ULRs* enter `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spacehuhn/hardware/master/wifiduck/package_wifiduck_index.json`. You can add multiple URLs, separating them with commas.
4. Go to `Tools` > `Board` > `Board Manager`, search for `wifi duck` and install `WiFi Duck AVR Boards` and `WiFi Duck ESP8266 Boards`.
5. [Download](https://github.com/spacehuhn/WiFiDuck/archive/master.zip) and extract this repository or [git clone](https://github.com/spacehuhn/WiFiDuck.git) it.

If you can't find the COM port of ESP8266 board, then you're probably missing the right drivers.
Here are links to drivers of the 2 most used UART chips on ESP8266 development boards:
- ðŸ’¾ [CP2102](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)
- ðŸ’¾ [CH340](https://sparks.gogo.co.nz/ch340.html)
