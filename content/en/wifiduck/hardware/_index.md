## Hardware

[Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/-Gmv98tUiYw)  

This tool requires following hardware:  
* An Atmega32u4 based board (for example: Arduino Leonardo or Pro Micro)  
* An ESP8266 or ESP8285 (for example NodeMCU or Wemos d1 mini)  
* [Optional] A single Neopixel (WS2812b) or Dotstar (APA102) LED

You will also need a computer and USB data cable to flash the microcontrollers.  

If you're a beginner,
it's recommended you wire everything together on a breadboard first!  
So get a breadboard with a couple of jumper wires.  

If you wish to solder everything together to a small DIY gadget,
you'll obviously need soldering equipment and a bit of experience using it.
