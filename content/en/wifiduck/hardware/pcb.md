![Preview of Pro Micro + Wemos d1 mini PCB](/media/wifi_duck/pcbs.jpg?height=300px)

To make the DIY process easier, I designed a small PCB.  

Design Files:  
* Pro Micro + Wemos d1 mini: https://easyeda.com/Spacehuhn/wifi-duck
* Pro Micro + NodeMCU: https://easyeda.com/Spacehuhn/diy-wifi-duck-pro-micro-nodemcu

You can also order them on OSHPark:
* Pro Micro + Wemos d1 mini: https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/ARCED9je
* Pro Micro + NodeMCU: https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/XUuUH1HB

You'll have to solder a Pro Micro board on one side and a Wemos d1 mini
or NodeMCU board (depending on the PCB) on the other side.  
That's it.  
You don't even have to solder all pins,
just the ones mentioned in [Connections](#connections), excluding the LED.
