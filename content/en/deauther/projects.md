**A collection of cool projects people made with the ESP8266 Deauther.**


I hope this gives some inspiration and motivation to make/hack something together yourself :)  
If you have a cool project that isn't listed here, let me know to add it by tweeting me [@spacehuhn](http://github.com/spacehuhn/)!

### Deauthing Sandals
Becky Button [@einsteinunicorn](https://twitter.com/einsteinunicorn) in collaboration with Naomi Wu [@RealSexyCyborg](https://twitter.com/RealSexyCyborg) designed and 3D printed a sandal. They put the ESP8266 Adafruit Feather HUZZAH in it, together with a LiPo battery to power it. 
A truly fun project that shows that you can put an ESP8266 everywhere!

### Drone Hacking a FAKE Makerspace
Naomi Wu [@RealSexyCyborg](https://twitter.com/RealSexyCyborg) had fun annoying a fake Makerspace in Shenzhen using a drone that drops an ESP8266 to send a bunch of SSIDs.
She used the [beacon-spam](https://github.com/spacehuhn/esp8266_beaconSpam) code for this but you can do the same thing with the deauther and a autostart script.

### Deauther Magnet Box for Fridge
[Tobozo](https://twitter.com/TobozoTagada) designed, printed and filled this nice box with an ESP8266 board, a 18650 Li-ion, a battery charger, a big 2.4 inch OLED, an on/off switch, a thumbstick and a few magnets to stick the whole box on the fridge!

### Deauth Detector with 10W RGB
Just a short video to show you that with the version 2.0, you can connect all kinds of LEDs!
I have a simple standalone [DeauthDetector](https://github.com/spacehuhn/DeauthDetector) script but here I used the deauther 2.0 as it has a build-in support for different LEDs and can also detect deauthentication frames when scanning.

### Pwned the pwner
Dave [@davedarko](https://twitter.com/davedarko) shows you in this quick video that changing the default password and SSID is a good idea! He made a script that searches for deauthers and try to log into them with the default credentials. When it's successful it will change the SSID and password and send a restart request.
But please note that this script was made for the 1.6 version and would need a few adjustments to work against the version 2.0.
