[mrvodka007](https://github.com/mrvodka007) created this user friendly all-in-one flasher tool.  
It helps you go through the process step by step and also provides the drivers you'll need.

### NodeMCU-flasher
Another easy to use GUI flasher, but this time only for Windows: [nodemcu-flasher](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-flasher).  
Select the COM port, go to config and select your .bin file at *0x000000*.   
Go back to Operation and click Flash.
