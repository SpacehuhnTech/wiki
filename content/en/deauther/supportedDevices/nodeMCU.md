This is the recommended board for beginners that want to learn more about electronics and programming!  
![External PICTURE NodeMCU v1.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spacehuhn/nodemcu-devkit-v1.0/master/Documents/NodeMCU_DEVKIT_1.0.jpg)  
The NodeMCU is an open source project and there are many companies producing it. The most known one is Amica. There is also a Lolin NodeMCU v3 but don't get confused by any version number:

I always recommend the v1.0 (might be sold under a different version number). It's the board from Amica. It is cheap, breadboard friendly and uses the cp2102, a better alternative to the old CH340 USB to serial chip.  
Please note that the quality of those boards can vary a lot! They are produces very cheap and you can get them for around 3 - 5 USD from AliExpress and other Chinese based sellers. So don't pay too much for them!  

There is also this NodeMCU inspired development board by DSTIKE:

It has a LiPo charger on-board and allows you to connect an external antenna for better range.
