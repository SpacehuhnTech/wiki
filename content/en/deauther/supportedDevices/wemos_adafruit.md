## Wemos D1 mini
The Wemos boards have decent quality, are cheap and very small.  
They work just like a NodeMCU and you can get a variety of addon shields for them!  
But you have to be careful, there are a lot copies of the Wemos products!  

## Adafruit HUZZAH ESP8266
Adafruit has a Feather board with the ESP8266 in their sore. Those are a bit more pricy than the chinese NodeMCUs but you get a very quailty board in return, good online documentation and a friendly community around it.
