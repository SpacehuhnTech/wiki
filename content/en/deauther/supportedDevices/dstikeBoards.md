If you want to support the development of this project, you can buy one of the offical boards by DSTIKE (Travis Lin) on following sites:  
- [DSTIKE.com ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ ](https://dstike.com/)
- [Tindie ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ ](https://tindie.com/stores/lspoplove)  
- [AliExpress ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ ](https://dstike.aliexpress.com/store/2996024)

- [Maltronics ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ ](https://maltronics.com/collections/deauthers)  

The Deauther boards come preflashed with the Deauther software and don't require the installation process.  
They are made especially for this project and come with a sharp 1.3 inch OLED screen, external antenna and 18650 battery connector. DSTIKE also offers a cheaper version without screen and a NodeMCU board. You can of course flash them with your own software and use them just like any other development board.
