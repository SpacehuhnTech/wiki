This software is written for the ESP8266. There are plenty of development boards available, all you need to do is choose one.  
The ESP8285, which is basically just an ESP8266 with embedded flash memory, is also supported.  
The ESP32 is **not** supported!  

### List of supplies
If you want to assemble the project yourself, you can find the parts you need [here](https://github.com/PwnKitteh/InsanelyCheapElectronics#deauther-20 "InsanelyCheapElectronics"). We recommend the NodeMCU for this, and you can use either of the displays linked there. 

**Some of the most used boards for this project:**
- [DSTIKE Boards](dstikeboards)
- [NodeMCU](nodemcu)
- [Wemos D1 mini](wemos_adafruit/#wemos-d1-mini)
- [Adafruit HUZZAH ESP8266](wemos_adafruit/#adafruit-huzzah-esp8266)
- [WARNING - Fake Boards!](fakeboards)
