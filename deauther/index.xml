Timeout error A typical message you get in the web interface is the red ERROR timeout loading file ... message.
Don&amp;rsquo;t worry!
It tells you that a transmission in the background failed.
This can happen because:
The ESP8266 web server is just randomly unreliable (nothing you can do here, just try again or use the OLED and buttons) The WiFi around is very crowded and transmissions are not reliable because of the high traffic (try changing the channel in the settings and restart, or use it in a less crowded area) You started an attack and the ESP8266 had to change the channel (you might have to reconnect manually) You&amp;rsquo;re scanning for stations (you can reconnect once the scan is finished) You&amp;rsquo;re attacking multiple targets and the ESP8266 has to change the WiFi channel constantly (you will have to restart to reconnect) The ESP8266 crashed - in this case, please look at Serial usage for further debugging.</description></item></channel></rss>
